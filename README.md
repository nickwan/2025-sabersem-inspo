# 2025 Saberseminar "Replications"  
Not exactly replications, but loosely based quick projects.  

VODs for me working on this notebook are these three from Twitch. At the time of writing this, they will exist for 6 more weeks. I don't think I'll rip these and upload to YouTube, so strike while the iron's hot I suppose.
